techinterviewprep: A repository of code I did to prepare for a technical interview 

About

================================================================================================

Most of the high-tech companies (Google, Amazon, Facebook, Yahoo) today have techinical interviews 
in their hiring process.

These interviews are used to measure the skills of the applicant. I created this repo to maintain 
the code I wrote to prepare for a technical interview.

For every topic I created a subdirectory, this topis are:

1- Sorting algorithms
2- Data structures
3- Strings manipulation
4- Match problems (mostly from eulerproject)
5- Combinatorial problems
6- Unix system programming
